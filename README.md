### What is it?
This is my attempt to recreate a [Falling sand](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/180-falling-sand) code challenge in a small Android app. The idea is taken from a popular community of p5.js lovers from Dan Shiffman lesson and his site [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/). Huge thank you Dan Shiffman for inspiring me to reinvent joy of coding again.

### How does it works?
Canvas view in Compose + separated by squares + manipulating of squares (pixels) + hot flow
